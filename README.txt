In this assignment we imporved upon assignment 3 in which we created a version of the 
strategy game "Flood It". We replaced implementation with an array stack with that of a 
linked stack and we added functionality for selecting the first captured dot, selecting 
colour by clicking dots directly, capturing diagonnaly, playing on a torus,undoing, 
redoing, and saving game upon quitting.
